You made a great choice! The Boston Terrier has several nicknames. The nickname for Boston Terriers is the roundhead because of the shape of this skull and it big, loving eyes. Their gentle manner and dapper looks earned them the name American Gentleman. The Boston Terrier is a lively little companion recognized by his tight tuxedo jacket, sporty but compact body, and the friendly glow in his big, round eyes. His impeccable manners have earned him the nickname 'The American Gentleman.' Boston Terriers are compact, short-tailed, well-balanced little dogs weighing no more than 25 pounds. The stylish 'tuxedo' coat can be white and either black, brindle, or seal (dark brown). The head is square, the muzzle is short, and the large, round eyes can shine with kindness, curiosity, or mischief. Ever alert to their surroundings, Bostons move with a jaunty, rhythmic step. It's a safe bet that a breed named for a city'the Havanese or Brussels Griffon, for instance'will make an excellent urban pet. Bostons are no exception: they are sturdy but portable, people-oriented, and always up for a brisk walk to the park or outdoor cafe. A bright dog with a natural gift for comedy, the dapper Bostonian is a steady source of smiles.</div>
